<h3 id="artpara">
  March Madness is always filled with upsets but this year‚Äôs March Madness was absolute insanity. From the start of the NCAA tournament, viewers were surprised and excited about the no.16 seed, Fairleigh Dickinson (FDU) beating the no. 1 seed, Purdue. A no.16 seed has been victorious against a no.1 seed only twice in the entire history of March Madness, the first time happening in 2018. What‚Äôs even more crazy about the game, FDU vs. Purdue, was that FDU had the shortest team in the tournament and Purdue with the tallest team led by 7‚Äô4‚Äù Zach Edey. Further into the tournament all the no. 1 seeds were knocked out, making it the First Elite Eight without any no.1 seeds since seedings began in 1979. Even with these upsets throughout the tournament, the most important round of March Madness was the most surprising.
</h3>
<h3 id="artpara">
  In the Final Four, the last teams standing were San Diego State (SDSU), Miami, Florida Atlantic (FAU), and UConn. This round of the Final Four was very unpredictable. No one expected any of these teams to make it this far. This was SDSU, Miami, and FAU‚Äôs first Final Four appearances. UConn was the most experienced team in this round having 6 Final Four appearances and 5 Championships. In the Elite Eight, SDSU had an intense game but defeated Creighton by one point. No. 9 seed FAU defeated fan favorite Kansas State, a no. 3 seed. Miami also defeated a triumphant Texas, and UConn upset Gonzaga to advance. The teams in this year‚Äôs Final Four fought hard throughout the tournament and earned a lot of the viewers respect.
</h3>
<h3 id="artpara">
  In the Championship round of March Madness, UConn faced off against SDSU. Both these teams had a triumphant run in the Final Four. UConn blew out Miami by 13 points (72 - 59). San Diego St. stunned the world by defeating FAU with a last second two-point buzzer beater, winning the game by one point (72 - 71). This advanced UConn and SDSU to fight against each other in the title game. UConn triumphed against SDSU as they won by 17 points, making UConn the National Champions! It was a great game and was a wonderful show of skill as these teams duked it out. Another surprising fact about UConn‚Äôs championship is that UConn has won every time they‚Äôve made it past the Final Four. This year of basketball is one to remember, I can‚Äôt wait to watch next year‚Äôs March Madness and how it turns out.

  <h2>Our goal is to provide a creative outlet for students to express their opinions and feelings regarding both school and our ever-evolving society. We feel that creativity and self-expression could be more encouraged in today's world so we wanted to allow a safe space for VAAS students to be themselves through both writing and arts. ‚ÄãThrough spreading news about issues within the VAAS campus, creating art pieces for the website, and encouraging being true to oneself, we believe that this will make our school a more open and expressive community, which will hopefully carry into students' adult years. </h2>
